      <p> Hello, Nice to meet you! I'm Kay. I'm currently 22 (2024), my birthday being Feburary 24, 2002.
        I'm half Burmese and Chinese, I mainly speak English or Burmese at home.
        I enjoy cooking, gaming, sleeping, watching something or being around family/friends.
        I would say I'm pretty out going and if I'm not I'm probably suffering somewhere mentally. (hahaha half joking)
        Sometimes I find myself stuck somewhere but I always try to resolve it one way or another.
        There's alot of times that I just kinda don't like myself but I know I should be thankful for what I have.
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn't have the best experiences growing up but I'm safe now and in better arms. I'm finally loved and
        appreciated for being me.
        I no longer feel alone and I feel like I can finally start growing, I was stuck for a very long time.
        That being said I would say one of the few places I like going is find a clean, warm spot by the window to just
        rest in comfort.
        I enjoy staying still and sun bathing alot, I dislike the cold and rain.
        I find myself more depressed on colder days and would rather just be warm.
        I'm a big cat person so I sorta started to act like a cat without really realizing it?
      </p>

      <p>
        They kinda just rub off on me like the two cats I currently have in the picture above me.
        Sadly, I'm severly allergic to animal fur so I suffer alot to the hands of these two cuties.
        Anything for cats honestly, I love other animals too but cats? very epic animals.
        Lastly the boring stuff about me is that I'm a Visual communications major and a minor in Comic studies.
        It's always boring to present yourself as a student above being yourself so I hope we get to be friends to
        whomever is reading this haha! Thank you for reading about me. â™¡
      </p>
