                    Surprisingly enough, not alot of people know I like this type of music for some reason.
                    The reason being as I normally play Jpop or Japanese lofi on the background of when I'm at home.
                    Sometimes I find myself listening to this playlist whenever I'm in a mood to dance again.
                    I love artists like Bruno Mars, Anderson.Paak, Midas Hutch, etc. Basically I'm into R&B and Pop
                    music,
                    very fun to
                    listen and dance to.

               <p> Yes haha, I listen to alot of jpop, I would say that this listen doesn't have EVERYTHING but has
                    enough that I
                    can
                    listen too.
                    The reason why I say that is because spotify doesn't have everything I like listening too.
                    Sometimes because artists don't put their music through spotify for some reason? I don't know but I
                    really
                    love
                    Vocaloid.
                    Vocaloid was a big part of my middle school and still is, I really adore the music and enjoy playing
                    with it.

                    I enjoy Korean pop as well, strangely did alot of dancing for it back in highschool. It's something
                    only
                    people who
                    knew me know iI did this.
                    I sorta lost my interest in kpop and korean r&b after highschool but a few years later now I find
                    myself
                    listening
                    to them again.
                    Remebering how much I actually enjoy and how much I sorta miss certain artists like VIXX, Block B,
                    Sistar and
                    Dean.
