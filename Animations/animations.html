      <p> This is considered to be the first anime I've ever watched in my life.
        I would always thank and appreciate the fact that my sister introduced this series to me.
        I would never not know anything about animations because of her and my spark of anime grew.
        The idea of pretty girls with epic space powers saving the world was definitely a mood.
        So much so I still wished I was a magical girl, as silly as it may sound haha.
        My sense of justice grew as silly it may sound because it was influnced by some japanese anime.
        Seriously it's crazy how much I wish I could save people and fight crimes hahaha.

        Kimi Ni Todoke means "From Me to You" a series that follows a girl named Sawako who has troubles
        with her highschool life because she's socially awkward and unfornately visually resembles "Sadako"
        or the japanese verison of "The grudge." Although she struggles she's able to make friends and
        meet a love interest who likes her almost instantly. This series as sappy and corny as it gets makes
        me cry every time and makes me SOOO in love with animation. A comedy, romance, and slice of life type
        of series that holds a special place in my heart like many other animations. This series however made
        me relate to the main character alot with how socially awkward I used to be. Now I'm just outright annoying
        and nothing close to what I used to be back in middle school/high school. HAHHAHAHA

        I WOULDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT JAPANESE ANIMATION WITHOUT MENTIONING ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS STUDIOS
        CALLED "STUDIO GHIBLI." As crazy as I may be, this studio makes one of the most craziest,
        heartwarming, heartwretching, always on my feet type of films. Films like Princess Mononoke,
        My neighbor Totoro (their mascot), Spirited away, Howl's moving castle and much more!
        One of the films that destories me the most is probably Howl's moving castle with how moving,
        loving, sad, and detailed the movie. Following a girl named Sophie in meeting the handsome Howl
        the magician who can do extrodinary things that lead to a whole bunch of crazy is honestly such
        a wild ride. I would always recommend ANY of the movies from this studio because it's just THAT good. hehe.
