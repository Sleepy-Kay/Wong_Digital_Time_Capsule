        I'm extremely extremely into video games!
        I started with Rainbox six siege and also Muse dash. But I came to like Overwatch recently!
        It's an almost hard to get but majority of the time good game to play.
        I enjoy playing it because I can be competitive and I find myself being an ok-gamer in the game.
        I also enjoy the many characters that get me super invested to play and try out.
        I normally find myself playing one specific character called Ramattra. He's a villian in the game but is super
        fun to play!
        Essentially I enjoy playing this character because of not only does he blow up everything with his fist but he's
        pretty epic to listen to when playing.
        Saying lines like "you shall suffer as I have" and or "rip them to pieces" because that's the sort of thing I
        want to hear when I'm punching someone in game. c:

        Another thing I like to play is Visual novels. The kinds of book to game type of deal that has a lot of mystery.
        I enjoy being able to play games where I get invested into characters and essentially cry a whole bunch after
        losing them.
        I'm not sure why this is a thing where all the characters keep dying, especially the ones I like the most.
        Like come on dude, I just started to get to know the person and the next chapter they just up and died.
        Anyways, still very good and interesting premises I like reading and actually playing as well.

        Suprisingly enough, people don't know that I enjoy horror games. Haha just kidding, everyone knows I'm into
        thiller, murder, homicide, blah blah blah
        I don't know why that is but I just enjoy being able to solve mysteries and also get very frustrated whenever I
        don't get something.
        I also don't know why I enjoy getting scared but I also think that it always keeps me on my toes so that I know
        I am struggling, enjoying and yeah.
        Frankily speaking, I don't think it's a good thing to be scared all the time or be paranoid after playing said
        games but I enjoy them anyways.
        I highly recommend checking out chillas art games because they're all bangers in my opinion. Also I enjoy horror
        rpgs weirdly enough that people don't know HAHAH.
